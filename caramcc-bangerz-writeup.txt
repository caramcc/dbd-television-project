0. GitHub Repository

The GitHub repo I have been using for this project is located at:
  https://github.com/caramcc/dbd-television-project



B. Data Tables contributed to Bangerz Data Collective:

All tables prefixed with `caramcc`:
  caramcc_tv_shows (45639 unique TV Shows)
  caramcc_actors (35936 unique actors)
  caramcc_creators (5037 unique creators)

Also contributed map tables and array-tables:
  caramcc_show_actors
  caramcc_show_creators
  caramcc_show_genres
  caramcc_show_languages

  caramcc_show_alternate_titles

Plus one table to store data about updates (for the auto-insertion scripts)
  caramcc_updates


C. Tables are populated with real world data on Bangerz

D. Data quality audits are in the README of my github repo for this project

E. Scripts that gather and insert the data are documented in my github README. Scripts that should be run to continually gather and insert data are:

  updates.rb - should run once or twice per week
  imdb_updates.rb - should run once or twice per month

F. SQL for table creation, insertion, updates, and deletes are found scattered in the various ruby scripts to gather/clean/insert the data. Documented on github README.

G. Scripts that export data as a JSON data dump 

H. Blog post zipped with this file, also found on github/bangerz at ~/caramcc/tv_shows_caramcc.html

I. Yes, I do want to be a co-author on the Bangerz Data Collective conference paper.

J. All scripts and SQL have a brief header stating that they are MIT licensed. A full MIT license can also be found in the README of the github repo.
