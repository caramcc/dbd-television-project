First Rollo established them in Normandy, forcing the French king to recognize him as its duke and royal vassal, which soon lead to adopting a largely french culture, while retaining their military excellence. One of his successors, duke William the bastard, conquered England at the battle of Hastings in 1066. Other knights set out from Normandy to southern Italy, and from there on crusade, founding a Sicialian kingdom and short-lived principalities in Antioch and Tiberias (Galilee).","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"52","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 60"}
