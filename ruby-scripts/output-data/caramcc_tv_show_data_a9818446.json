Several dancers from Club MTV later moved on to this show. The music played was rap, R&B, hip hop and occasionally alternative. The show was first apart of Hangin w/MTV and was hosted by Eric Nies before it turned into it's own show and was called \"The Grind\" in the fall of 1992. The Grind would also have several outdoor tapings during the summer months instead of only during Spring Break.. The show was taped at several different resorts ranging from Lake Havasu, Miami, Hawaii, and Las Vegas. Eric Nies left the show as host in 1995 and was replaced by various special guest hosts. In 1996 the show was revamped and stopped playing mainstream music and opted for underground dance, house, and club music. The show lasted until 1997 and after months of runreuns was once again revamped greatly and all the regular dancers from 1992-1996 were no longer featured. It was shortly let go from MTV's lineup in late 1997 and no other similar dance show has since aired on MTV.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.2","imdb_votes":"29","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 30"}

In a series full of surprises, the programmes will show how this ancient trade has not only reflected, our sexual habits, moral outlook and attitudes to women but has helped to shape the world we live in. The prostitutes lot has been constantly shifting - over time whores and harlots have been elevated, abused, exploited and commodified . But as Lucy discovers , it's a surprisingly resilient profession that has defeated all attempts to suppress and control it. We live in a world which seems to be ever more tolerant of prostitution but increasingly concerned about exploitation and the series will explore how far we have or haven't come over the centuries.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"N/A","imdb_votes":"N/A","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 60"}

To reduce the risk of Quates tracking them all down, the group separates and goes their separate ways. Neither of them crosses paths again till 1930, Manhattan, when Quates manages to create a new elixir of immortality. However, he loses it and it ends up going around town, taken to be a bottle of alcohol and unknowingly drunk by many residents. The drinkers of this new elixir include Isaac and Miria, an eccentric pair of thieves; the Gandor brothers, a Mafia family; and their associates in the Camorra, the Martillos (who employ some of the original immortals). Now, not only are a new group of immortals created, but the simmering criminal underworld is about to explode.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.5","imdb_votes":"4,178","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, Japan, tvr: JP"}
