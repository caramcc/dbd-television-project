Helping him is his restless son, 34-year-old Lamont; Fred's beloved wife and Lamont's mother, Elizabeth, had died more than 20 years earlier. Fred's schemes and bigotry especially toward Julio, a Puerto Rican who was Lamont's friend, whites and other minorities often frustrated Lamont. Fred also showed overt disdain for his sister-in-law, Aunt Esther (the feeling was mutual). Many times, Lamont threatened to leave for meaningful work, but Fred faked a heart attack each time (\"Oh, this time its real, I'm a-comin' 'Lizabeth!\") as a sympathy ploy to get his son to stay. By 1977, Fred and Lamont had sold their business (stars Foxx and Wilson wanted to leave the series); it became the Sanford Arms, a rooming house. The show continued as the short-lived \"Sanford Arms\" (without Foxx or Wilson); it was revived in 1980 on CBS as \"Sanford\" (starring Foxx and without Wilson).","award_wins":"2","award_nominations":"12","imdb_rating":"8.0","imdb_votes":"4,018","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}
