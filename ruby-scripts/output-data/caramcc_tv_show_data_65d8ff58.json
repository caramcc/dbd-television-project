However, in spite of that situation, the samurai and the Yin Yang fortune-teller were continuing the ugly argument for the hegemony. The Emperor felt sorry for people in pain, and he ordered Minamoto No Raiko, who was an expert of a bow, to search the legendary comma-shaped bead of having the supernatural powers which bring about peace in a capital. However, Raiko was suffered from the epidemic, and became ill in bed. Therefore, the end daughter of Minamoto, Hikaru No Kimi, hid her true figure and made a trip to look for the bead instead of her elder brother. During her trip, she met various kinds of people, and she increased the comrades, including a faithful partner, Watanabe No Tsuna. Hikaru met the handsome actor, Mansairaku, and the mysterious Yin Yang fortune-teller, Abeno No Seimei, who maneuvered secretly in the black side of the government, and she was involved in various accidents. Though she felt for Mansairaku, she hid her feelings, and acted like a guy. Then she would gradually throw herself into the big battle for the capital.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.6","imdb_votes":"68","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

But this is the era of the French Revolution, when the French citizens were living in utter poverty while the French royal family and nobles were surrounded by extravagant luxury. The irony and cruelty of such conditions was unbearable, and while Oscar has a duty towards the ruling class, her sense of compassion and kindness moves her to support the poor. This series examines the historical occurrence of the French Revolution, where the peasants of France led a revolution against the nobles, as seen through the eyes of Oscar.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.6","imdb_votes":"669","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}
