Each week, two or three country music stars guested usually one or two of the guests being well-established, the others newer and up-and-coming stars as well as bluegrass, country gospel and other acts, signers and musicians popular with country audiences. During the final segment of each show, the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet (through the mid-1980s, usually co-hosts Owens and Clark, along with Kenny Price and Grandpa Jones) performed a gospel song. The shows were taped only a few weeks out of the year, usually weeks (and sometimes, months) in advance; that meant some of the short-lived \"newer\" acts had already lost their star power by the time the show they were featured in had aired. By the early 1990s, the show started to abandon its rural, barnyard set in favor of a nightclub setting, though popular \"rural\" settings were still used; that, plus the show's booking of newer pop-oriented country acts alienated more than a few longtime viewers, who believed \"Hee Haw\" should have maintained its traditional country focus. During the 1992-1993 season, Clark hosted a series which featured clips from classic \"Hee Haw\" shows, along with new footage.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.8","imdb_votes":"693","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Two contestants competed on this short-lived offering from Fox.

Two correct answers sends the \"lucky\" sap ... er, winner off to the Chamber. There, the contestant is strapped in and hooked to heart rate and blood pressure monitors. A series of seven levels are played, each lasting one minute. The Chamber fluctuates constantly between Hot (surrounded by flames) and Cold (ice-cold water squirted at the contestant) modes; the Chamber also rotates, sometimes at varying speeds; other distractions (such as wind gusts and tacks showered on the contestant) are added as the game progresses. While all of this is going on, host Schwartz poses general-knowledge questions to the contestant. Each correct response is worth $1,000; if the contestant misses two successive questions, asks to call off the game, or his/her heart rate and/or blood pressure exceeds a pre-determined \"Danger Level\" for at least 20 seconds, the game ends immediately and the player forfeits half of their winnings to that point. However, if they have advanced through all seven levels and have correctly answered at least 25 questions, they get triple their winnings (gee, the things people will do for money). \"The Chamber\" and its bretheren, _\"The Chair\" (2002)_ sparked immediate controversey, and only three episodes of \"The Chamber\" aired before Fox put a stop to the torture and cruelty of the series.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"3.7","imdb_votes":"27","genres":true,"runtime":"60 min","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Instead of presenting a traditional wrestling program, \"TNT,\" as the show was commonly known, combined the sport of wrestling and entertainment (hence the term \"sports-entertainment\"). Adopting a talk-show format similar to NBC's \"The Tonight Show,\" WWF wrestlers and their managers were interviewed by hosts McMahon and Hayes. Comedy skits featuring the WWF stars were a major part of the show examples included the Wild Samoans demonstrating the many ways to prepare raw fish; a \"wedding\" which evolved into a massive pie/food fight; Cowboy Bob Orton complains of an arm injury and goes to the doctor with Roddy Piper in tow; and the many spoofs of TV shows and movies. Other features were pre-taped promos, or vignettes, of the WWF stars; question-and-answer segments with members of the studio audience; promotions of upcoming WWF events; and updates of current WWF happenings. On occassion, wrestling matches were featured. Unlike most wrestling matches, most of TNT's material was ad-libbed and/or improvisional acting.

The latter two segments were shown on alternate weeks during the first season. During the show's second season, only \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Q*Bert\" returned.

One spins the wheel and the other one stands ready to begin a task. If the wheel lands on Mayhem, the second child goes over to Smashin' Sam and Tearin' Aaron to complete a task (usually messy) for a maximum fifty points. The other parts of the wheel have things like quiz rounds, point reversals and something called \"Uh Oh.\" When the wheel lands on Uh Oh, the second child is locked in a small room until the first can answer a multiple-choice question. If they get the question wrong, the Punisher splashes the second child with goo. After all three teams have taken turns spinning the wheel, the show moves on to the Slime Tour round. This section is hosted by Shawn Majumder and is usually found somewhere across Canada. It is an obstacle course. The teams in the studio must vote for who they think will win the race, for a bonus of twenty points.

Jenny, the young vet, who hates nothing more than sitting around doing nothing, decides to travel to New Zealand with Vicky. She finds it very hard to say good-bye to her father, Dr. Gordon, and to her beloved horse Black Beauty. She is confident that Nigel has succeeded in making his way to New Zealand against all odds. Weeks later, when Jenny and Vicky arrive at the farm in the south of New Zealand, they discover to their dismay that it is deserted. Neither the manager, who was supposed to look after the cattle and the fields, nor any living creature whatsoever can be found. But the young vet and her step-daughter do not give up easily. They turn up their sleeves and work to make themselves at home. They get some unexpected assistance from a young German called Manfred, who had secretly moved into the stables, believing the farm to be deserted. Vicky and Jenny like him immediately. He pitches in with a will and makes himself useful in many ways. However, Vicky is astonished to discover that Manfred does not ride. On the contrary, he is terribly afraid of horses. But he is a talented tinkerer who keeps inventing new original gadgets such as a flying machine. By and by, the two women settle down. One day, they find a beautiful black stallion who will allow nobody but Vicky to ride him. The horse reminds Jenny of her beloved horse back in England, so she christens it Black Beauty.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.6","imdb_votes":"28"}

The show played off the success of Barbara Mandrell's fast-exploding country career, which included sell-out concerts and a string of No. 1 hits (most notably, \"Sleeping Single in a Double Bed\" and \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\"); in fact, the Country Music Association named her Entertainer of the Year in 1980 and 1981.

As soon as she arrives, little Misaki sees a giant video screen showing a battle between two women: a larger one garbed in black, and a smaller one wearing white. Enthralled at their amazing fight, Misaki immediately falls in love with the game when the smaller woman wins. In this game, she sees, size doesn't matter. Curious to know more, Misaki has the good luck of running into an older man who goes by 'Icchan,' wiggles about like a serpent, is prone to sudden crazy behavior, and becomes her mentor in the game. The women, he reveals, are actually dolls called Angels, and they are controlled by players called Deuses in the game Angelic Layer. Anyone, even someone as young and as little as Misaki, can play. Hooked by his words of encouragement, Misaki buys her very own Angel which she names Hikaru. Showing amazing natural talent, she quickly makes many friends in the Angelic Layer community, including a kindergarten girl who is an Angelic Layer genius, her big brother who gets a crush on Misaki, and his childhood friend who regularly practices her karate moves on him. Soon her confidence grows and Misaki and Hikaru are headed for the national games. But what does Icchan have to do with the tournament? And could her long lost mother have a part in all this? Packed with amazing battles, quirky humor, and even budding love, Angelic Layer is a fun-filled trip of empowerment and discovery that everyone can enjoy, no matter how big or little, old or young.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.1","imdb_votes":"203","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

As before, the show's colorful host, Bozo the Clown always be-decked in a blue outfit, red hair and nose and oversized shoes led the activities for the show's audience of children, youth groups and organizations, and adults. Staples of the show included songs, skits, stories, circus and vaudeville acts and games. The Grand Prize Game invited (as picked at random) one boy and one girl from the audience to toss ping-pong balls into a line of six buckets, from increasing distances, for prizes. And of course, the cream pies kept flying in the faces of the regular cast members. By 1997, Bozo began leading exercises for the children, and videotaped segments of trips to such educational places as a museum and fire station, were featured. The Chicago-based \"Bozo Super Sunday Show\" was the last show featuring the immortal clown to be produced, as many stations that had their own local Bozo shows (180 stations at one point) had ceased production of either daily or weekly shows to air syndicated childrens programming or, probably more often than not, tabloid news (e.g., \"A Current Affair\") and trash-talk programs such as Jerry Springer. Throughout Bozo's 40-year Chicago run, more than 2 million \"boys and girls, moms and dads\" were members of the studio audience.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.9","imdb_votes":"24","flag":"runtime differential: omdb 120 min vs tvr 60"}

Lazer Tag Academy is a cartoon based on the Lazer Tag toy and was produced by Ruby Spears Animation. It aired on NBC from Sept. 13, 1986- Aug. 22, 1987 and was canceled only due to the bankruptcy of Worlds of Wonder, the makers of Lazer Tag. In the mid 90's the rights to Lazer Tag Academy were purchased by Saban Entertainment (owned by Haim Saban who did the music for the show) and it re-aired under the title Laser Patrol on the Sci-Fi Channel. In July 2001, Saban's library of more than 6,500 episodes of children's programming was purchased by Disney as part of the Fox Family Channel buy-out (FFC was owned by Saban).

Each week, two teams (as chosen months in advance by the NFL) met in what has become a Monday night tradition. Usually, a trio of sports-casters (a play-by-play announcer joined by a color commentator and an analyst) called the action. Half-time interviews with coaches and players, and sideline reports after outstanding plays were also innovations that contributed to the appeal of these games. Many of the games proved to be exciting, though sometimes the games were boring (especially if the teams were a mismatch or not very good, a necessary risk since the games were scheduled months in advance). Often serving as part of the announcing team were former NFL greats including OJ Simpson, Dan Dierdorf, Joe Namath and Lynn Swann.","award_wins":"2","award_nominations":"14","imdb_rating":"8.5","imdb_votes":"697","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 210"}

Initial storylines focused on adultery, drug use, frigidity, rape, gossip, homosexuality, marriage problems, racism. The building's ground floor delicatessen run by Hungarian Jew Aldo Godolfus and the nearby laundrette provided central meeting places for characters. Original residents included busty blonde virgin Bev Houghton who fell in love with her neighbour, homosexual lawyer Don Finlayson. Don's flatmate lover was Bruce Taylor, a photographer who was secretly being kept financially by his employer, the bitchy and sardonic Maggie Cameron. Friendly Vera Collins read tarot cards for a living; her husband had deserted her and she would be perpetually unlucky in love. In flat 8 lived immigrants from Lancashire, whining Alf Sutcliffe and his salt of the earth wife Lucy, who worked in the laundrette. Interfering, malaproping gossip Dorrie Evans was the building's self-appointed \"conserge\"; her husband was the more friendly Herb. Lovable rogue and ladies man Jack Sellars romanced Bev, Aldo had the problems of his rebellious daughter Rose before she got married and moved away, and Aldo's new wife Roma Lubinski joined him in his comedy attempts to use modern Australian idiom. Also coming to work at the deli was new resident, the bookish young Arnold Feather. A wine bar opened in the building, run by bubbly Norma Whittaker. She and her amateur inventor husband Les moved in to live in flat 1. Camp young movie fan Dudley Butterfield arrived to work in the wine bar, and Dorrie's old friend and now lodger was the no-nonsense Flo Patterson: a perfect foil for snobbish Dorrie. Maggie Cameron later became part owner of the building, frequently making unsuccessful attempts to evict the residents. The regimented Reg \"Daddy\" McDonald, has dizzy wife Edie \"Mummy\" McDonald and their ebullient daughter Marilyn later moved in the flat 5. An early storyline was the dreaded 'knicker snipper', a devious intruder who ransacked the women's bedrooms and cut holes in their panties and bras. Later comedy storylines were added, while 1974 saw more crime with the horrific panty-hose strangler killing off two young women residents, and attacking one other. 1975 saw four major stars killed off in the infamous bomb-blast episode: a failed attempt to boost the show's by then declining ratings. Australia's first full frontal nude scene was added during the later episodes in 1977 but nevertheless, ratings waned and the series eventually ended, with Dorrie, Herb and Don the only original characters still around at the end.","award_wins":"5","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.0","imdb_votes":"52","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Australia, tvr: AU"}

Four such questions were played; the players used the spins to accumulate cash and prizes on an 18-space board. One contestant at a time is in control of the board; he/she stopped a randomly-flashing cursor by pressing his signal device (and usually the scream \"STOP!\"). The contestant wins whatever appears in the lit space a cash amount, a prize, perhaps an extra spin or other action space ... or it could be a Whammy, which caused the contestant to lose all he/she had accumulated in that game. The Whammy was an animated devil who starred in the sequences, which played when a contestant lost his winnings. As long as a contestant is in control of the board, he/she can continue to press their luck and possibly lose their accumulated winnings on the next spin or elect to pass his/her remaining spins to an opponent (the leader or the player in second place, depending on who passes), meaning he/she must use those spins. Any player who lands on four whammies is eliminated from the game; the high scorer after two rounds is the winner and returns. Only the winner keeps what he/she had won; a player continued until winning five shows, until defeated or winning $25,000 (later $50,000, then the winnings limit at CBS). The most famous contestant on \"Press Your Luck\" was Michael Larson, who memorized the flashing patterns of the gameboard cursor. Putting his knowledge to use, he racked $110,000 in cash and prizes during his 1984 appearance on the show (which was broken into a two-part show); the game was soon redesigned by the producers to prevent future fortune-hunting gameplay. For years, \"Press Your Luck\" reruns aired on the USA Network; Game Show Network was scheduled to begin airing reruns of the show starting in September 2001. \"Press Your Luck\" was based on the 1977 game show, \"Second Chance,\" which was largely identical to the later game show.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"3","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"253","genres":true,"runtime":"30 min","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

It prompted the creators Roger Price and Geoffrey Darby to air a prime-time TV series shown all across Canada. First a pilot episode aired on Saturday Morning on May 12, 1979 as they hired Ruth Buzzi to play the female adult roles as well it had a musical guest by Vancouver rock band Trooper. The pilot was a success so in the fall starting on September 18, 1979 the series aired every Tuesday night at 7:30 on CTV as 16 episodes were purchased. The skits had certain topics like Union Fees, Fan Letters/Summer Camp and Superstitions and Educational Programming and like it's sister show it was about kids being kids. There were also musical guests by Canadian bands like Ian Thomas, Max Webster, Cooper Brothers and Alma Faye. Because the series appealed to kids 11 and under it was an odd combination as kids couldn't related to rock bands and didn't know who Ruth Buzzi was. Not only that, a prime time slot wasn't right for a series like that. After the 12th episode in December of 1979 the series was canceled but however, it's sister show You Can't Do That On Television re-aired in early 1981 on Saturday mornings airing nationwide and used some of the characters that were fresh off of the other series which became popular for the show. Whatever Turns You On did however re-aired in reruns when a Canadian station YTV became new to the public in 1988 but sadly it only aired for one season.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.1","imdb_votes":"92","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Canada, tvr: CA"}

It's up to Custard the indolent, grinning purple cat, and the rest of the garden animals to make sure nothing comes of them so that their idle tranquility can be preserved, and score points off Roobarb's inflated ego at the same time. Some of the episodes defy belief, such as the one in which Roobarb decided Thursday should be Thor's day, and pretends to be the Norse god of thunder. This only incurs the wrath of the real Thor, who responds by turning the hapless dog into a variety of ludicrous shapes, to the hilarity of the other garden animals.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.1","imdb_votes":"131"}

The alien competitor turns out to be the curvaceous Lum, so Ataru relishes the idea of having to catch this beauty. However, his attitude changes when he discovers that Lum can fly. When things start looking desperate for the Earth, Ataru's girlfriend, Shinobu offers to tie the knot if he succeeds, and on the last day, when he finally catches Lum, he declares his intentions to be married. Lum misunderstands this as a proposal and eagerly agrees, since she has become smitten with Ataru. He tries to disengage himself, but Lum is adamantly faithful and demonstrates a willingness to use her natural ability to generate electric shocks to keep her \"husband\" in line. Later in the series continuity, Lum and some of her alien friends become more-or-less regular residents of Tomobiki and interact with the natives, who are interesting in their own right. Urusei Yatsura is unique for its premise, its immense cast of characters, and its free-for-all, anything-can-happen attitude.

Ahiru discovers that Mute is actually the prince out of a story written by the mysterious writer Drosselmeyer. When Drosselmeyer died, the prince and the evil crow he was battling in the story escaped. The prince defeated the crow, but only at the expense of shattering his own heart. Mute is a boy without feeling or understanding. Drosselmeyer, however, has somehow returned, and has offered Ahiru a chance to help Mute. She must become Princess Tutu, a magical ballerina, and help reclaim the pieces of her prince's heart. There is a catch, of course--Mute is being controlled by his roommate Fakia, also a dancer, who seems to want to keep the boy soulless and heartless. Drosselmeyer also told Ahiru that a certain dream she's been having is real. She really is just a little duck, and has been transformed into a girl only so that she can become Princess Tutu. If she starts stammering-- quacking like a duck-- she'll turn back into one.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.3","imdb_votes":"512","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

After their father runs off with his teenage mistress, SOPHIE and KAREN KERR decide their family needs a fresh start. They convince their mother, LYNN, that the big city holds promise for all of them. Sophie has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious Manhattan private school, Karen can pursue her dreams of modeling, and Lynn can leave the painful memories of her failed marriage behind her, while reviving the ambitions of becoming a fashion designer she put on hold to raise a family. The Kerr women arrive in New York ready to build a new life, as they try their hand at making it in this rarified place that promises as many challenges as it does possibilities. Manhattan. Global big shots, CEOs, diplomats, and the self-important social elite all make their homes there, and they send their precious children to the Brighton school. When Sophie enters this world she realizes she has no idea how to fit in with the privileged, posturing social climbers at her new school, the so-called \"BPs,\" aka \"Beautiful People.\" It's nothing like her old life, where she was able to rise to the top of the academic heap without effort. Not so at Brighton, where everyone is above average and her fellow students think nothing of a lunchtime shopping trip to Prada or of using their parents' helicopter for their morning commute. Sophie's adorable charm and refreshing lack of pretension attract two very different boys to her; GIDEON, a sensitive artist and an outsider in spite of his wealth, and NICHOLAS, the sexy, self-assured leader of the \"BPs\". Because of her stunning beauty, things always came easily for Sophie's older sister, Karen. But in the big city, she quickly encounters the harsh realities of the cut-throat modeling business and quickly discovers that in New York, the competition is always a little bit taller or a little bit thinner. It will force Karen to take risks in order to succeed and decide just how much of a sacrifice she's willing to make. After a series of frustrating jobs, Lynn manages to land a position in the fashion industry, working for a hot designer. Making the situation more complicated is that the job puts her in daily contact with her old college flame, married millionaire JULIAN FISKE, the one great love of her life. Julian still has feelings for Lynn, and she wrestles with her own emotions, and morals, as their relationship threatens to turn romantic. Helicopter rides, high-rises, and hedonistic parties - the Kerrs are definitely not in New Mexico anymore. No matter what challenges the City throws their way, or what temptations may lead them astray, these three women are a family, and will always be there for each other. For all three Kerr women New York will be an incredible adventure, and challenge working to stay together as a family while pursuing life and love in the greatest city on earth, as they realize what the true meaning of what beautiful people really is.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.1","imdb_votes":"984","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 60"}

Father Duddleswell (Arthur Lowe) as he tries to break in his inexperienced and idealistic young curate Father Boyd (Daniel Abineri). The priests' lives at St. Jude's Parish in London are hilariously complicated by an unflappable and tart housekeeper (Gabrielle Daye), a stern and imperious Mother Superior (Sheila Keith), and a flippant worldling neighbor, Billy Buzzle (David Ryall). Plots revolve around crises that make Catholic parish life both charming and frustrating, e.g., fund-raising and parish bazaars, the seal of confession, complications over funerals, etc.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.9","imdb_votes":"98"}

A gunman with an AK-47. Three officers trapped without ammo. His partner frozen in fear, Detective Jim Dunbar without hesitation took action of intense bravery that killed the gunman, saved the officers and made him a hero. He also took a bullet that blinded him forever. Most officers injured in the line of duty opt for desk jobs or early retirement. Not Dunbar. He's rehabilitated both body and attitude and fought his way back to active duty. His fresh start at a new precinct is threatened by the simple truth that no one really wants him there. His new partner, Karen Bettencourt, doesn't trust that she can rely on him. However, being blind makes Dunbar a better cop than he ever has been. Steven Bochco's drama stars Ron Eldard (frequent guest star of ER (1994) as Dunbar, who tackles the issue of handicapped employees head-on. Unique visual effects give us a window on what Dunbar \"sees\" with his remaining senses, as he learns to be a better cop and a better man. He has a long way to go to conquer his demons, but at least he's back on the streets.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.4","imdb_votes":"340","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Hosted by Bob Keeshan (at one time, he played Howdy Doody's friend, Clarabell) from the appropriately-named Captain's Place, the Captain was so named because he always wore an overcoat with large, kangaroo-like pouches. Each show featured stories, skits, vaudeville acts, songs, games and other educational activities. Captain Kangaroo's friends were Mr. Green Jeans (who always brought an animal to the show); Dennis, an apprentice handyman and do-it-all person; and Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit. Bunny was always mute, but made his point ever-so-cleverly, while Mr. Moose always tricked the Captain into allowing him to stand under a shower of pingpong balls. As the show got on in years, new features were added, including Uncle Backwards (a tape of some simple action, such as peeling an orange or building a doghouse, shown in reverse); \"Picture Pages,\" a matching activity hosted by Bill Cosby; and Slim Goodbody, which taught children about health, nutrition and physical fitness. Many actors, actresses and singers guest starred. In the early 1980s, new formats were attempted, all without success including the early morning \"Wake Up with the Captain\" (which starred new puppet friends and employed the joke-of-the-day); by 1984, the show ended its 29-year CBS run. During the early 1990s, Bob Keeshan hosted a daily series airing on PBS; it featured clips from the classic program along with new footage.","award_wins":"8","award_nominations":"19","imdb_rating":"8.3","imdb_votes":"446","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

When a mysterious extraterrestrial signal is detected emanating from Mars, the world security organization known as Spectrum sends agents Captain Scarlet and Captain Black to investigate. The two men soon discover the source of the signals: a huge alien city, which materializes into visibility before their startled eyes. The aliens dispatch a probe to examine the Earth vehicle, but Black assumes it to be hostile, and fires a burst of missiles which utterly destroys the entire city. However, the alien buildings immediately reform using an unearthly process known as retro-metabolism, and the city's inhabitants, the Mysterons, immediately retaliate by killing Black and declaring war on Earth. The Mysterons are able convert anyone or anything to their cause by destroying the original and then recreating it as a new, 'Mysteronised' agent - capable of employing any means necessary to bring about the downfall of the human race. From Spectrum's high-flying center of operations, Skybase, its leader, Colonel White, uses all available resources to thwart the Mysteron threat, including a crack team of colour-coded agents; the sleek but deadly Angel Interceptors, also known as Falcons; the tank-like Rhinos; and the ultra-fast Raid bikes. One of Spectrum's top agents is Captain Scarlet; once a Mysteron agent, Scarlet was able to throw off his conditioning and regain his sense of loyalty to Spectrum, with the added bonus that he is now indestructible.

Number cards (including the 10) are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 (meaning a jack, king or queen), and the ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (on a contestant's choice). In every round, each celebrity will be staked $100,000. For hands 1-11, the minimum wager is $1,000 and the maximum wager will be $25,000. Starting with hand 11, the minimum wager will be increased to $5,000 and no celebrity can make any maximum wagers at this point, therefore a contestant can wager everything they have on a given hand. If a celebrity accumulates 5 cards without going over 21, that celebrity is an automatic winner and instantly receives a payment of 1:1 on their bet. Also on deck, each card contains 6 jokers. When a contestant is dealt a joker card as one of the first 2 cards, they will have a decision to replace that card with any other card that's on the table once each player has received their first two cards. They can also take the dealer's up card, if they wish.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.0","imdb_votes":"17","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 60"}

Jeremy, who is in love with Aelita, struggles through season 1 to find a way to \"materialize\" Aelita, so she can become human by exiting the scanners that connect Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi to Lyoko. If Jeremy accomplishes this, he will be able to shut down Lyoko and defeat XANA. We witness Jeremy finally materializes Aelita, and accomplish his dream. The group deactivate Lyoko, but XANA apparently infected Aelita with a virus before she was materialized so that if XANA goes, she does too! In the beginning of season 2, we witness the dawn of new technology. Jeremy programs vehicles into Lyoko for faster travel and makes a better scan program to detect \"activated towers\", so Aelita can live on Earth without having to stay in Lyoko to look out for XANA's attacks on Earth! ALong with that, Jeremy announces that he is working on an antivirus good enough to save Aelita from XANA! Franz Hopper, a brilliant scientist, seems related to Aelita after some research.

One day, while Shinichi and Ran are at an amusement park, the pair become separated. Shinichi catches wind of a dirty deal going down, and spies on a pair of men in dark trenchcoats. He's caught and the men use an experimental poison on him, intending to kill him. However, things don't work exactly as planned. When Shinichi comes to, he finds he's shrunken down to the size of a fourth grader. He goes to the goofball inventor that lives next door to him for help, and the inventor agrees to give him a hand. When Ran comes looking for Shinichi, he and the inventor come up with a story saying that Shinichi is a child named Conan Edogawa (Conan as in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). Ran offers to let \"Conan\" live with her family while his \"family\" is away. Shinichi then makes it his mission to one day find the men who poisoned him and get the antidote. Thus concludes the backstory to the series. In each episode, Conan solves a different case in the style of all good detective shows, giving hints to help the viewer try to guess who the villain is, while trying to keep his true identity a secret.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.5","imdb_votes":"4,544","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

Filled with dreams of being a cool teenager, Chris moves with his family from the projects to the \"Bed-Stuy: Do or Die\" neighborhood. As the family's emergency adult while his parents are working, he's responsible for taking care of his younger brother Drew (Tequan Richmond), who's taller and more confident than Chris, and sister Tonya (Imani Hakim), who gets all the parents' attention. Chris' rough, cost-conscious father Julius (Terry Crews) works numerous jobs to properly support his family. Sassy mom Rochelle (Tichina Arnold) runs the household on a tight budget, is very strict, and works part-time in a small real estate office. With his mom determined to see him in a good school, though Drew and Tonya go to the same school in their old neighborhood, Chris reluctantly faces multiple bus transfers every day to attend Corleone Junior High in the fiercely Italian neighborhood, South Shore. Despite being an immediate target for bullies, Chris' innate charm and sharp wit enable him to make new friends, like Greg (Vincent Martella), another smart, nice kid... who can't fight, by the way. As Chris Rock pointedly looks back, his younger self is set to find what his family already knows: Chris' sharp, scrappy character is going to take him places. But first, he's going to have to think, talk, or run his way through one growing experience after another at home and school... and on any number of buses along the way.","award_wins":"7","award_nominations":"50","imdb_rating":"7.3","imdb_votes":"24,378","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

His daughter Paige, a Harvard brain, will date every attractive male in the story and cause them mixed emotions, while her brother Lane sways even more between dad's ruthless enterprise and his own drug addiction and dealings with murky Mook, fighting each-other and the police.

The young couple had hoped their children would adopt the same values. How wrong they were, especially in the case of oldest son Alex. \"Family Ties,\" which was based in Columbus, Ohio, explored the relationship between Steven (a public television station manager), Elyse (an architect) and their three children, Alex, Mallory and Jennifer. Alex was an avid Reagan devotee and card-carrying Young Republicans Club member who sauntered through the house in a shirt and tie and hung a picture of William F. Buckley over his bed. But as intelligent and over-achieving as Alex was, Mallory was as underachieving and, to say the least, a slacker; she was more concerned with shopping and cute guys. Jennifer was the precocious youngster who just wanted to be a normal kid. Skippy Handleman, one of Alex's best friends, was a geeky next-door neighbor with an unrequited crush on Mallory. During the 1984-1985 season, Elyse gave birth to Andrew, her and Steven's fourth child. Alex quickly took his young brother under his wing, and before long Andrew was reading the Wall Street Journal over his Froot Loops cereal. As the years passed, Alex graduated from high school (as salutatorian) and pursued a financial degree from Leland College. It was there he met his first serious girlfriend, the beautiful Ellen Reed (played by Fox's future wife, Tracy Pollan). After that relationship ended, Alex met psychology major Lauren Miller. Meanwhile, Mallory (who was in serious danger of flunking out of high school) found love in the form of Rambo-wannabe and high school-dropout Nick Moore, of whom Steven and Elyse (at least initially) strongly disapproved; Alex disliked the motorcycle-riding Nick even more. Mallory, however, did graduate from high school and became a fashion design major at Grant College. Nick also obtained his general-equivalency diploma. While there was time for fun and laughs, many episodes explored serious topics, such as: teen pregnancy, censorship, addiction to pills, the effects racial minority homeowners have on property values and grieving the loss of a close friend. Other episodes dealt with Steven's distant relationships with his own family, particularly his brother, Robert, while plenty of episodes presented flashbacks of earlier episodes featuring the Keaton offspring as young children. By the time the series wrapped up, Alex accepted his dream job offer...a job on New York's Wall Street.","award_wins":"22","award_nominations":"43","imdb_rating":"7.2","imdb_votes":"10,081","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Each night ABC would begin a summation of the days events in Iran immediately after the local news. Koppel's show became a permanent fixture, and was expanded to a full hour. Rather than start the show on Fridays at 12:30am, ABC tried to move the show to primetime, at 8pm, and on a different day of the week, no less! The last latenight episode featured Melanie Chartoff and Brian Mahler remaining in character but going off script and complaining about going to primetime. And they were right. The latenight audience did not find them, and the show was cancelled shortly thereafter.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"288","flag":"runtime differential: omdb 70 min vs tvr 90"}

These creatures existed as stone in the day, but become flesh and blood at night. One Scottish clan made an alliance with humans to help protect a castle by night if the humans would protect their stone forms by day. The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed, leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the \"castle rises above the clouds.\" For a thousand years, the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse. In 1994, a wealthy multibillionare named David Xanatos bought the castle and transported the whole structure to Manhattan where he placed it on top of the Eyrie building which he owned. It is high enough to be above the clouds, thus the conditions of the spell were met and the Gargoyles were revived. Now, this clan must adjust to this new age and gain friends, like Detective Elisa Masa who reveals that Xanatos revived them to exploit them for his unscrupulous ends. This is coupled by the fact that another Gargoyle comrade, Demona, is alive from their age, and is now an insane renegade bent on the extermination of humanity. Rebelling against them, the clan abandon the castle and pledge to protect New York like they protected the castle in the past.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"12","imdb_rating":"8.1","imdb_votes":"9,230","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

The show ran from 1963 to 1971 on NBC (first on Sunday afternoons and later in prime-time).

All that changes when the colony meets a boy with a Gummi Bear medallion which unlocks the Great Book of Gummi which reveals lost knowledge of their past. Now the colony has dedicated themselves to the new goal to rediscover their heritage with the help of a few trusted humans while preventing new enemies like Duke Igthorn from exploiting that heritage to their own ends.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"5","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"4,557","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta's handler doesn't like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don't play by the agency's rules...they will die.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.6","imdb_votes":"1,534","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 30"}

Young girl Junko Tama also gets involved, and after Shirou took her to his family's house for safety, Destron monster Scissors-Jaguar stumbles onto her and before Shirou's eyes, kills his whole family (his father, mother, and younger sister)! But before Shirou and Junko were about to be killed as well, Shirou's friend Takeshi Hongou, alias Masked Rider 1, comes to the rescue! An enraged Shirou wants to be a Masked Rider just like him and Hayato Ichimonji (Rider 2), but the Double Riders won't allow it (they don't want another cyborg burdened by the loss of humanity), until, that is, Shirou sacrifices his own life to save them from a trap set by the mysterious Leader of Destron in the remains of Gelshocker's old base. With leftover surgery equipment, the Double Riders transform Shirou into the powerful third Rider, Masked Rider V3! However, the Double Riders sacrifice their lives to save Tokyo from another Destron monster, Turtle-Bazooka, who had an atomic bomb hidden in his body! Kazami had to use his powers to fight Destron without the guidance of the Double Riders. Along with Toubei Tachibana (the mentor of the first two Riders), Junko, and the Kids' Rider Team, Shirou fights the evil forces of Destron as Masked Rider V3! Later in the show, another hero appears in the fray, the anti-Rider Riderman! Jouji Yuuki, a top Destron scientist, was betrayed by Marshall Armor, Destron's commanding officer at the time. He lost his right arm when Armor dipped him over a pool of acid, but his fellow scientists rebelled and saved his life. He was not only given an artificial right arm, but also uses the Riderman helmet, which transforms him into Riderman, and has a twisted vendetta with Marshall Armor. Kazami/V3 tries to convince him that Destron is an evil organization, but Riderman refuses to understand. Will V3 and Riderman eventually work together to defeat Destron?","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.4","imdb_votes":"44","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

Six contestants are each given $1000 to start with, and then they answer eight multiple-choice questions, adding $500 for each answer that they get right. As they play, each contestant will only know their own score. At the end of the questions, the scores of all of the contestants are revealed to the viewers, then host Andrew G asks the contestants to share their thoughts about the round and how they performed in it. It is up to the contestants to decide if they want to answer truthfully or try to bluff the other contestants into thinking that they did better than they actually did. The contestants then step forward towards their own \"fold buttons\" to take the \"con test\", and after some more discussion, they are given a ten-second countdown. If any contestant thinks, rightly or wrongly, that they have the least amount of money, they can choose to hit their button and fold, taking the money that they have earned to that point. If no one has folded by the time the countdown hits 0, then the contestant with the lowest amount of money is eliminated, and leaves the game with nothing. If there is a tie for the lowest score, then the speed with which the contestants selected their answers is used as a tie-breaker, with the slowest contestant being eliminated if they don't choose to fold. In the subsequent rounds, five questions are asked and the amount of money for a correct answer increases by $250 each round, and each round is followed by another \"con test\". After the last two remaining contestants have answered the final five questions (with every correct answer worth another $1500), they take one final \"con test\", where if one of them chooses to fold, they will take home the money they have accumulated over the five rounds, but will hand the major prize of $50,000 to their opponent. If neither of them fold, then the person with the higher amount of money wins the $50,000, and the person with the lower amount of money leaves with nothing.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"4.0","imdb_votes":"8","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Australia, tvr: AU"}

Host Fred Rogers (known to millions as simply \"Mister Rogers\") used his gentle charm and mannerisms to communicate with his audience of children. Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations and disappointment about not getting one's way to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchild and Daniel Striped Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers' shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War.","award_wins":"5","award_nominations":"60","imdb_rating":"8.5","imdb_votes":"1,928","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Like its earlier novel and big-screen brethren, \"Mr. Belvedere\" featured British butler Lynn Belvedere, who takes a job as a live-in nanny for a typical American family and records their everyday experiences in his diary for future use in writing a novel. In the 1985 small-screen version, the Owens family served as that \"typical American family\" and the source of fodder for Belvedere who had previously worked as a gentry for Winston Churchill and had connections to British royalty. Family patriarch George (played by sports-caster Bob Uecker) was, in an example of art imitating life, a sports writer; the matriarch was Marsha, a law student. The couple, which had settled in suburban Pittsburgh, had three children: Awkward teen-ager Kevin, precocious (and easily embarrassed) Heather and mischievous prankster Wesley. George was initially uncomfortable hiring the worldly Belvedere, but eventually came to appreciate the Englishman's friendship (as well as his expert culinary skills). Wesley, unlike his elder siblings, seemed to never get along with Belvedere; however, even he came to appreciate the British native's advice that he would regularly dispense to the family. Each episode ended with Belvedere writing in his journal, giving the show's moral while putting everything into perspective. In later years, Marsha graduated from law school and got her first job, while Kevin (and later, Heather) graduated from high school and entered college. The 1985 small-screen adaptation of \"Mr. Belvedere\" marked the end of a long succession of unsuccessful attempts to bring Davenport's novel to television; the three earlier pilots were made in the 1950s (soon after the final big-screen movie) and 1960s.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"12","imdb_rating":"6.6","imdb_votes":"1,981","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

The present talents are his two sons, Nathan Scott, a beautiful and popular athlete, the absolute star, who was molded and stifled by his proud dad, ambitious Dan Scott, who pushes him harder then even the coach approves of, but rather neglected by his spoiled, impulsive mother Deb, an alcoholic, and Lucas, abandoned at birth with his devoted mother, hard-working café-owner Karen Roe, who grew up with Dan's older but poor brother Keith as substitute father as a social reject, only playing hoops on a public yard in the park with street-kids, his passion being reading; when an incident forces the coach to replace suspended players, Lucas soon proves the revelation, and after a while gets accepted and develops a dynamic, in the long run good relationship with his brother, who turns on his dad. Of course the teenage boys have friends, and especially a confusing series of usually short-loved 'eternal' love affairs with musical talents Peyton and Haley, also a tutor, and irresistible man-eater Brooke...","award_wins":"3","award_nominations":"27","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"49,382","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Del and Rodney are best described as lovable and harmless black market traders; they buy and (try to) sell almost anything and many an episode is based around some faulty/stolen stock bought by Del.

Max Evans, Isabel Evans and Michael Guerin are teenage humans with extraordinary gifts - gifts that are \"not-of-this-earth\". They are human/alien hybrids, sent here to complete their destiny. Their counterparts have already perished in a war of attrition, thus one day, they will return to their home planet and save their race. Before a fateful day in 1999, the teens hid their gifts. The event that forever changed their lives was when Max healed Liz Parker (a classmate) after she was fatally shot in the stomach in a dispute between two customers at the restaurant where she waitresses. A close relationship then develops between Max and Liz. Central to the first season were the relationships between the hybrids and their human companions. That focus has shifted during the drama's second season. \"Roswell\" is now distinctly a science-fiction show built on the relationships between humans and aliens.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"20","imdb_rating":"7.5","imdb_votes":"19,291","flag":"runtime differential: omdb 42 min vs tvr 60"}

Fred's schemes and bigotry especially toward Julio, a Puerto Rican who was Lamont's friend, whites and other minorities often frustrated Lamont. Fred also showed overt disdain for his sister-in-law, Aunt Esther (the feeling was mutual). Many times, Lamont threatened to leave for meaningful work, but Fred faked a heart attack each time (\"Oh, this time its real, I'm a-comin' 'Lizabeth!\") as a sympathy ploy to get his son to stay. By 1977, Fred and Lamont had sold their business (stars Foxx and Wilson wanted to leave the series); it became the Sanford Arms, a rooming house. The show continued as the short-lived \"Sanford Arms\" (without Foxx or Wilson); it was revived in 1980 on CBS as \"Sanford\" (starring Foxx and without Wilson).","award_wins":"2","award_nominations":"12","imdb_rating":"8.0","imdb_votes":"4,018","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

However, as most government-funded agencies usually are, Sealab is manned by a motley collection of malcontents and screw-ups who were unfit for work in the private sector. They really don't get any research done, but instead spend their time bickering among themselves. Or just plain goofing off. The crew have manipulated their luckless leader, Captain Murphy, into submission, and are content to ride the government clock, raking in fat, hazardous-duty paychecks.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.0","imdb_votes":"4,364","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

But when his mother dies suddenly, Bastian's limitless imagination is reborn. Bastian comes across a magical book, \"The Neverending Story\", in a curious little bookstore. Inspired by the book, Bastian creates an enchanted world called Fantasia, inhabited by dragons, dark knights and assorted heroes and villains. The adventure of a lifetime begins when Bastian projects his Fantasian alter ego, Atreyu, into a battle against the sinister force of The Nothing. This terrible force threatens to destroy Fantasia and its ruler, the Childlike Empress. Only Atreyu, a 14-year-old Woodland boy and unlikely hero, can save her and find a cure for The Nothing. Bastian's experiences in the real world; such as his mourning, his new, sometimes tumultuous life with his dad, his problems with a school bully and his terror of a new, sadistic substitute teacher, are mirrored by Atreyu's experiences in Fantasia. Along with Atreyu, Bastian overcomes obstacles, learns important life lessons, and gains insights that help him adjust to the sudden death of his mom.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"4","imdb_rating":"5.2","imdb_votes":"552","flag":"runtime differential: omdb 375 min vs tvr 60"}

Forrester Creations is the premiere fashion house in the city, thanks to the designing brilliance of Eric Forrester and the money and social grace of his wife, Stephanie Forrester. The ups and downs of their on-again, off-again marriage parallel the stormy lives of all their children, who have shared lovers and spouses with one another and even with their own father. Ridge Forrester is the arrogant oldest son (whose paternity will eventually be called into question); Thorne, the oft-neglected younger son; Kristen, the sweet but sexually-frigid older daughter; Felicia, the wild child. At the center of many of these storms is the Logan family. Beth Logan, the matriarch, has always carried a torch for Eric. Her three daughters include Brooke, the willful and sexually promiscuous oldest; Donna, the ditsy model; and Katie, who has always felt overshadowed by her more beautiful older sisters. Into the lives of these two families comes the brazen Sally Spectra of Spectra Fashions, a knock-off house that has frequently stolen from Forrester; Taylor Hayes, the beautiful but emotionally-troubled psychiatrist; Sheila Carter, a devious and homicidal nurse; the Marone family, with closer ties to the Forresters than anyone would have dreamed; and many others. Death, divorce, alcoholism, duplicity, betrayal and adultery are the everyday concerns, while murder, attempted murder, rape, impersonations and returns from the dead are the bizarre shocks that happen with dreadful regularity.","award_wins":"83","award_nominations":"274","imdb_rating":"3.5","imdb_votes":"4,780","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

He also meets Al Floss, the quintessential agent, oily, sneaky, deceptive. One day one his clients is arriving and he instructs Richie to meet him cause he doesn't want any of the other \"mail room\" people making a move on his client. Richie, not wanting to give him the satisfaction, sends Teddy instead. Now the man is arrogant, and pompous, he picks a fight with Teddy, that ends with Teddy slugging him to his knees. Teddy's spunk impresses the man that he wants Teddy to be his agent now. Al Floss is not happy about it, and he tries to dissuade Teddy from accepting his request. But Abe Werkfinder feeling that as long as the man wants to stay with his agency, he must do what he can to make him happy. So he convinces Teddy to accept, the high paying job, and instructs Al to train him. But Al is not exactly in his corner, so Teddy must rely on Richie and his secretary Laurie for help. And because his name is such a tongue twister, Mr. Werkfinder dubs him Teddy Z.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"5","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"70","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

By 1975, Jefferson's fledging dry-cleaning business, Jefferson Cleaners, had successfully grown into a small chain; his newfound wealth led to moving his family to a \"deluxe apartment in the sky\" in Manhattan. His family included his wife, Louise, a level-headed and open-minded woman who often had to scold George when his mouth got him into trouble; and Lionel, an engineering major at a local college. He especially disliked Tom and Helen Willis, a mixed couple (he was white, she was black) whose daughter, Jenny, was dating and later married Lionel; Florence, his sharp-tongued maid; and Harry Bentley, the esoteric Englishman who lived next door. George often flaunted his wealth and displayed rude, arrogant, bigoted behavior; however, he often found that money didn't open every door or win him favor with everyone. In later years, George and Louise became grandparents (welcoming an adorable little girl, Jessica); and Lionel and Jenny found work he as an electrical engineer, she as a fashion designer. However, Lionel and Jenny's marriage soon began to crumble. Meanwhile, as Jefferson Cleaners continued to expand, George continually had to deal with competing dry-cleaning franchises, who sought to put George out of business. In the final season, George and Tom formed a partnership and purchased Charlie's Bar, their favorite hangout.","award_wins":"5","award_nominations":"23","imdb_rating":"7.5","imdb_votes":"3,669","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

He is foiled either by the bumbling antics of his deputy, Perkins, or the integrity of his other deputy, Birdie Hawkins. During the show's second season, the naive Governor, who was visiting Orly, was impressed by Lobo's unorthodox methods, appoints him to his crime fighting task force and sends Lobo, Perkins, and Birdie to Atlanta. Now the chief of detectives, whom Lobo reports to, is incredulous as how Lobo can help him, especially after meeting Perkins, so he doesn't assign them to anything important. So Lobo has to steal or grab a case on his own and hopes that the Chief will be impressed. Hildy, the chief's secretary, doesn't think that Lobo can do any good, but offers help if it means that she can go out into the field. About the only support they get is from Brandy and Peaches, two ambitious detectives, who occasionally work with Lobo, although they're more interested in snagging the credit for themselves.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"6.2","imdb_votes":"203","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}
