Why and how he came here is a mystery, one that will have Mel digging through old family records and learning why her grandmother's bar is called \"The Watchfire\".

The universe is modeled largely after the Star Trek universe, with references to 'warp drive' and 'transporter' beam technology, occasional time travel, the Federation and the Vulcans. The series also includes elements borrowed from other sources such as Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Battlestar Galactica. The general setting is that known space is politically divided between two superpowers: the Confederation (led by Humans, and a parody of the Federation from Star Trek) and the Dark Clown Empire (a parody of the Galactic Empire from Star Wars). The Dark Clown Empire is a totalitarian, tyrannical police state, led by the evil Darph Bobo. In contrast, the Confederation is technically a democratic and free society, but in practice, is dominated by mega-corporations and bloated bureaucracies. Ultimately, both superpowers end up exploiting and restricting their inhabitants, albeit in different ways. For example, the value placed on life is so commercialized in the Confederation that clearly sentient robots and androids are reduced to essentially slave-status. The Dark Clown Empire practices actual slavery, and while the Confederation does not, most of its inhabitants (including the Human ones) are openly described as living in wage slavery. The only place that anyone can truly be free is in the border region between the two superpowers, which is directly controlled by neither. This borderland is known as \"the Rift\", hence those outlaws on the fringes of society who cling to their freedom by moving back and forth around the Confederation/Dark Clown Empire border to evade detection are said to be \"Tripping the Rift\". The series follows one such group of outlaws led by Chode aboard the Spaceship Bob, taking odd-jobs and usually pursuing various get-rich-quick schemes.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.0","imdb_votes":"1,678","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, Canada, tvr: CA"}

There are the just-married Nic and Angelo, the seemingly happily married Dave and Deena and the newly-engaged Marjorie and Adam. But -- what about Brian? Of this close-knit group of friends, everyone else has paired off, while Brian has emerged as the last bachelor standing. At 34, regardless of his run of bad luck in matters of the heart, Brian still holds out hope that one day he'll open the door and be blinded by love. However questions about his fate have been popping up more frequently in his head. The most pressing question is - and it's one that only he can answer -- could all of his problems stem from the fact that he is harboring a crush on the picture-perfect Marjorie, his best friend's girl? Adam, Brian's best friend since childhood, was going to break up with Marjorie but found himself proposing to her instead. He's a lawyer and Marjorie is a pediatric surgeon. Their busy lifestyles leave them little time to plan their upcoming wedding and, oddly enough, that seems to have given them more time to re-evaluate whether they're indeed doing the right thing. Brian's fortysomething sister, Nic, and her boy-toy husband, Angelo, are trying hard to start a family, but something's not right. Nic's high-stress work as a record executive and Angelo's fledgling acting career have created some anxiety in the new marriage. Now they're torn between conceiving a child the old-fashioned way or using modern medicine to speed up the process. Dave, who runs a video game business with Brian called Zap Monkey, is married to stay-at-home mom Deena. They've been together for 13 years, have three little girls and a lackluster sex life. This prompts the frustrated and unconventional Deena to suggest to the more content Dave that they consider having an open marriage. Like all married people and their single friends, they can't wait for Brian to join their \"club,\" though they're not exactly sure why.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.3","imdb_votes":"3,128","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Oftentimes, co-host Walters interviewed a prominent celebrity, politician or other newsmaker (among her most famous interviews included her fearless interview of feared Libyan dictator Muhammar Qaddafi; and her inspirational story of Gen.

Host James announces a category, each with three as-of-yet unrevealed questions--a \"who,\" a \"what\" and a \"where\" question. Each question also had odds posted, based on the question's difficulty (most having even or 2:1 odds, with others had up to 5:1 odds). Each contestant secretly selects one question and wagers up to $50 on their ability to answer. All three wagers are revealed; if just one player chooses a specific question, he gets to answer it, with the contestant winning his/her bid multiplied by the odds if correct or losing his wager if he/she is wrong. However, if two or perhaps all three contestants choose the same question, only the highest bid is accepted; however, if two or all three bids on the same question are identical, the $50 limit is waived and the contestants can bid up to their entire bankroll. Only the winner of the auction gets to answer the question, with the wager added and multiplied or subtracted appropriately. The format is repeated through several rounds, with contestants able to bid up to $100 after an unspecified point in the game. For the final question, all contestants with positive scores could wager up to their entire bankroll on one final category, again with three question choices. The rules for answering were identical to previous rounds. All contestants kept what they had won, and the player with the highest cash winnings was champion and returned to the next show. Champions continued until winning five games or until defeated.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"8.4","imdb_votes":"7","flag":"country not equal: omdb: N/A, tvr: US"}

Host Roth shows an out of focus picture (e.g., person, place, thing or a T.V. show), every time the contestant buzzes in with the right identification to the picture earned 10 points and the same contestant was asked a multiple-choice question about the picture (e.g., pop culture, storybook, spelling words, places, etc.), worth 5 points. The first team who ended the game with 50 points was able to run inside the maze with the help of his/her partner, after a decision has been made (whether if he/she will go first or second). Then, after the first team won, the remaining two contestants went right into the speed round where each correct picture was still 10 points and host Roth will no longer have to ask anymore questions. An incorrect guess on a picture meant that Roth would read a clue to what that picture is without revealing anymore of it. The second team with 50 points went right inside the maze. In earler episodes of Season 1 is that the 3 contestants have 10 seconds to buzz in and correctly identify the picture to win whatever point value was awarded on the clock, and then the contestant can answer the question correctly in order to double their points. If time runs out or if all 3 contestants gets the picture wrong, then no points was awarded at that time, and the 1st 2 teams who ended the game with more than 50 points went into the maze. In the maze, after all the kids have been dressed up, the contestants' partner uses the joystick to connect with their partner (in any direction his/her partner chooses), before winning the game, in the fastest time. In the Mirror Maze, the contestants' partner must navigate the contestant to the Mirror-Man (who eventually took over their path), and the contestant must answer a question correctly posed by Roth in order to proceed. If at anytime, the contestant answers the question correctly, then they are free to go, but if they get it wrong or can't come up with an answer, then host Roth will automatically ask another question, 3 incorrect answers and/or passes the contestant has already made will force the contestant to wait for 5 more, until the runner is told to go. While finding 2 Power Sticks, the contestants' partner would have him/her go to the Honeycomb Maze, where the contestants' visor had to come down and his/her partner would have to direct him in the appropriate area of the contestant of where he/she is supposed to go, into the Chamber of Knowledge. After the contestant was told to put his/her visor up, then he/she entered the chamber to answer all 3 true/false questions from three of the six guardians. If the contestant gets 1 right from a guardian, then the door automatically opened, if the contestant gets it wrong, then one of the 5 guardians asked another question. 3 incorrect answers automatically opened the door with excessive time. If the contestant gets all 3 correct answers, then he/she took a short trip to the jar to stop the contestants' time. Then, its team #2 turn to do the same, to see if the contestant can beat the contestants' time (e.g., 1:56 (best time ever), 1:57, 2:40, 4:30, etc.), and if the contestant does this even quicker, then the contestant went on to the Prize Mountain. If not, then their opponents automatically went on to Prize Mountain. In Prize Mountain, there were 5 monitors, (e.g., both of them flashing PRIZE/NO PRIZE), after their partner locks in on the monitor, the contestants' job is to point their lazer, aim and (shout fire very often). If the contestant fired in on 3 \"PRIZE\" monitors before locking in on 3 \"NO PRIZE\" monitors, then the contestant went home with a grand prize (e.g., a $500 shopping spree at Sharper Image at Beverly Hills). In the fall of 1995, Roth was replaced by actor/heartthrob, Mario Lopez, and the rules stay the same, but the buzzers were replaced by laser podiums and there was a \"Bonus Picture\" worth 15 points, and once again, 2 teams who ended the game with 50 points went into the maze to see which teammates has the fastest time.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"2","imdb_rating":"7.6","imdb_votes":"13","flag":"runtime differential: omdb N/A vs tvr 30"}

A mysterious web of coincidences will gradually draw them closer, changing the course of their lives forever. Is it happenstance? Is it fate? Is there a greater force at work in our world, guiding us along and connecting our lives? Laura, a grieving single mother, begins the chain.

Some have called it an early prototype or rip-off of \"Wheel of Fortune\" without the wheel, but the two shows started broadcasting at approximately the same time (Definition may slightly predate 'Wheel'). In typical Canadian (low budget) style, it featured bored housewives from Hamilton or Scarborough, Ontario who were teamed with Canadian film and television celebrities to solve a puzzle, with the grand prizes awarded on the show often being along the lines of a Schaeffer pen set and a vacuum cleaner. However, there were occasional 'Tournament of Champions' weeks during which they gave away a car as the grand prize for the tournament champion. Most of the celebrities were more locally known than international stars, but there were occasional early appearances by Martin Short or others who have since become more widely known. What most people remember about the show was its jazzy little theme, which was actually composed by Quincy Jones in the 1960s. The theme was heard in later years as a sample on the Canuck rap group Dream Warriors' hit single \"My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style.\" It was also heard over the titles in the film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, which may explain why it was a bigger hit in Canada than in the U.S. The tune later appeared in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and made a prominent appearance in the opening sequences of 'Austin Powers: Goldmember'. Jim Perry, meanwhile, went on to host \"Sale of the Century,\" in which a contestant broke a record by winning more cash and prizes than anyone else in game show history.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.7","imdb_votes":"15","flag":"runtime differential: omdb 30 min vs tvr 60"}

Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Pro Football, Presidents, Science and Nature, Famous Bobs, Automobiles and Words), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $10 to $50. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., \"Presidents for $10\"), to which host Fleming reads the answer (\"The Father of our country; he really didn't chop down a cherry tree\"). Contestants had to respond in question form (\"Who was George Washington?\") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was \"always in jeopardy\") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated. Hidden behind one of the answers was a \"Daily Double\" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings (or up to $50 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into \"Double Jeopardy!\" Gameplay was the same in \"Double Jeopardy!\" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $20 to $100 and two \"Daily Double\" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $100 if they had less). At the end of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play \"Final Jeopardy!\"; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was eliminated and given consolation prizes. Fleming announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. Everyone kept their winnings and the contestant with the most cash (usually not more than $1,000) was champion and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated) or until they were defeated. The highest-scoring contestants and all five-time champions over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $25,000; there were also college tournaments and celebrity shows conducted.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"4","imdb_rating":"8.1","imdb_votes":"230","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

Beginning in Season 1 when Henry VIII was growing desperate for an heir and growing distant from his first wife, the series moves quickly to the period when Anne Boleyn became his obsession. During this time Cardinal Wolsey rose to become the power behind his throne, ruling ruthlessly and nearly absolutely while Henry (played by Johnathon Rhys Meyers) for the most part followed the Cardinal's advice, maneuvering through a series of betrayals and plots against him. When Anne Boleyn plays much harder to get than any woman ever has, Henry begins to search for a way out of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, so that he can make Anne his wife. Needing a divorce, Henry turns to Wolsey, who promises to help him create waves of backlash from the church, as well as the Spanish Habsburg dynasty and its overseas empire. Against this background gyrate the private lives and political intrigues of several members of the royal court and chancery. This includes Henry's friend and his sister Margaret's true love Charles Brandon, the Habsburg ambassadors, greedy and power-hungry schemers, their incidental victims and composer Thomas Tallis...","award_wins":"48","award_nominations":"66","imdb_rating":"8.1","imdb_votes":"43,869","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Ireland, Canada, USA, tvr: US"}

Fighter pilots from all over the world are being hired as mercenaries, or even shanghaied on occasion, by both sides of the conflict to fly and fight for them. One of the locations where Asran's government sends its mercenaries is Area 88, a secret military airbase surrounded by desert and close to the frontline, where they must live and can never leave it. Since every pilot has his or her own unique fighter jet, the airbase often looks like it's hosting an exhibition of various real-life fighter planes from all over the world. There are only three ways for a government-hired mercenary pilot to quit this war - complete a three year contract as a mercenary, pay a fine of one and a half million US dollars, which is an improbable but not impossible feat, since every confirmed kill can bring up to 75 grand in rewards to the pilot responsible, or try to escape, although desertion is punished by death. Shin Kazama, a strong silent type is a respected combat ace and the only Japanese pilot among the mercenaries in Area 88. He is also one of the few that were deceived into joining the war. To make things worse, the man responsible for this cruel deception was his best friend, which puzzles Shin. The people closest to Shin on the base are hotshot US pilot and war vet Micky Simon, very young and insecure but spirited North African pilot Kim Aba, the only female fighter pilot on the base - self-confidant and competitive Kitori Palvanaff who's also airbase commander Saki's cousin and aggressive overzealous photojournalist Makoto Shinjou who's recently arrived from Japan, supposedly to report on the war, but who has a somewhat suspicious fascination with Shin. All Shin wants is to earn the 1.5 mil, pay the fine and return home to the girl he loves. What he doesn't know is that he's running out of time to accomplish this.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"7.1","imdb_votes":"59","flag":"country not equal: omdb: Japan, tvr: JP"}

Behind the celebrities' podiums was a wall of six electronic screens, which contained the words to a familiar phrase. The basic rules were similar to \"The Hollywood Squares\" (e.g., choose a celebrity, agree or disagree), but with the following changes: 1. When the contestant chose a celebrity, he/she also picked a star in in his/her column to light (i.e., \"so-and-so at the bottom\"); 2. The celebrity is asked a multiple-choice answer, and generally did not bluff; and 3. If the contestant was correct, he/she continued control of the board, but if not, control passed to the opponent. Whenever four stars around a screen were lit, that screen exposes part of the phrase. At any time, the contestant in control of the board may guess the phrase, always at the risk of losing control if incorrect. The first contestant to solve two puzzles won a prize package worth approximately $4,000 and advanced to the Blitz Bonanza Board. In The Blitz Bonanza, the object was for the contestant to solve one more word puzzle; by spinning a wheel, the contestant could highlight and reveal portions of the puzzle. Up to four spins were allowed, though spins could prove to be unhelpful if they designated an already-highlighted screen. If fewer than four screens were lit, the contestant could either solve the puzzle or trade the prize package already won in the front game (all previous winnings were considered safe) for one more spin. Following the fifth spin, the contestant has 10 seconds to review the puzzle; at the same time, the celebrities write down their guesses as to the correct phrase. At any time during the Blitz Bonanza, a correct guess was worth $10,000 (plus an additional $5,000 for each day not won, up to a maximum $25,000); an incorrect guess at any time stopped the Blitz Bonanza, though he/she could collect $250 per celebrity who guessed the puzzle correctly. Contestants competed until defeated or winning five games, at which point they also won a new car.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"N/A","imdb_rating":"N/A","imdb_votes":"N/A","genres":true,"runtime":"30 min","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}

The host read a question asked of 100 people in a certain group (e.g., mothers-to-be, homecoming queens & Congressmen). The questions could be serious, funny, cute ... but were always interesting. The 1st contestant had to predict how many of those 100 people answered a certain way, while his or her opponent had to guess whether the actual figure was higher or lower. The contestant who was correct played a card game based on Acey-Deucey; he or she was shown their base card (they could play it or change it) and had to guess whether the next card was higher or lower than the previous one(1) card. {The Playing Cards ranked from Ace(High) to 2(Low)}. Any incorrect judgment (miscall or mistake) or a duplicate card had the overturned cards except the base card discarded and allowed the opponent a chance at his/her row of cards (no change of the base card allowed); players could \"freeze\" at any point to keep their opponent away from their cards or to gain an advantageous position. Up to four questions were played per game, with the 4th and final question called \"sudden death.\" One game to complete all 5 cards calling Higher or Lower wins $100 and be the first(1st) player to win two(2) games collects $200 played the Big Money Cards; if a third (3rd) game was required, a \"Sudden Death\" round with 3 cards and a maximum of 3 questions was played. In the Big Money Cards, the champion used an initial purse of $200 to bet on a series of seven cards (positioned on a three(3) row board, with an extra $200 ($400 in 1986-1989) given after play of the third card); originally, the base card on only the first row could be changed, but this was later changed to changing the base card on each row; correct guesses earned the player their bet, while wrong guesses or a duplicate card lost the bet. Starting in October 1980, the contestant did not lose money if the exact card came up. The final card, if they didn't \"BUST\" (i.e. lost everything) on the second row was the \"Big Bet,\" where the contestant had to bet at least half(1/2) of his/her cash. Up to $28,800 was possible. Champions continued until defeated or until winning seven(7) games. The Game Play was largely similar in the 1986 CBS/syndicated revival with the following changes: 1. Questions could also involve \"educated guesses\" or general knowledge questions with numerical answers and a special 10-member polling group seated in the audience who played for the entire week. 2. In 1988, the tiebreaker game was changed to one sudden death question. 3. One card on each row in the Big Money Cards could be changed. 4. In October 1986, after the Big Money Cards (for a chance up to $32,000), players could use any jokers found in the deck to help them win a new car with the help of 7 numbered cards (1 \"CAR\" & 6 \"No\" Cards); In July 1988, this was changed to a question read about the 10-member polling group, with a player winning the car for guessing the number exactly by moving a blue diamond shaped marker to place the number from 0 to 10. The player could win an extra $500 if they were one away from the correct number. The Show changed from 7 wins to 5 wins on CBS-TV & Syndicated.","award_wins":"N/A","award_nominations":"2","imdb_rating":"6.8","imdb_votes":"151","flag":"country not equal: omdb: USA, tvr: US"}
